                      draft-foudil-securitytxt-01

Abstract

   When security risks in web services are discovered by independent
   security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they
   often lack the channels to properly disclose them.  As a result,
   security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a
   standard to help organizations define the process for security
   researchers to securely disclose security vulnerabilities.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Many security researchers encounter situations where they are unable
   to responsibly disclose security issues to companies because there is
   no course of action laid out. security.txt is designed to help assist
   in this process by making it easier for companies to designate the
   preferred steps for researchers to take when trying to reach out.

1.2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Specification

   security.txt is a text file that should be located under the /.well-
   known/ path ("/.well-known/security.txt") [RFC5785] This text file
   contains 4 directives with different values.  The "directive" is the

Internet-Draft     A Method for Web Security Policies       October 2017


   first part of a field all the way up to the colon ("Contact:").
   Directives are case-insensitive.  The "value" comes after the
   directive ("https://example.com/security").  A "field" always
   consists of a directive and a value ("Contact: https://example.com/
   security").  A security.txt file can have an unlimited number of
   fields.  It is important to note that you need a separate line for
   every field.  One MUST NOT chain multiple values for a single
   directive.  Everything MUST be in a separate field.

   A security.txt file only applies to the application it is located in.

2.1.  Comments

   Comments can be added using the # symbol:

   <CODE BEGINS>
   # This is a comment.
   <CODE ENDS>

   You MAY use one or more comments as descriptive text immediately
   before the field.  Parsers can then associate the comments with the
   respective field.

2.2.  Separate Fields

   A separate line is required for every new value and field.  You MUST
   NOT chain everything in to a single field.  Every line must end with
   a line feed character (%x0A).

2.3.  Contact:

   Add an address that researchers MAY use for reporting security
   issues.  The value can be an email address, a phone number and/or a
   security page with more information.  The "Contact:" directive MUST
   always be present in a security.txt file.  URIs SHOULD be loaded over
   HTTPS.  Security email addresses SHOULD use the conventions defined
   in [RFC2142].

   The precedence is in listed order.  The first field is the preferred
   method of contact.  In the example below, the e-mail address is the
   preferred method of contact.

   <CODE BEGINS>
   Contact: security@example.com
   Contact: +1-201-555-0123
   Contact: https://example.com/security
   <CODE ENDS>

2.4.  Encryption:

   This directive allows you to add your key for encrypted
   communication.  You MUST NOT directly add your key.  The value MUST
   be a link to a page which contains your key.  Keys SHOULD be loaded
   over HTTPS.

   <CODE BEGINS>
   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt
   <CODE ENDS>

2.5.  Acknowledgement:

   This directive allows you to link to a page where security
   researchers are recognized for their reports.

   <CODE BEGINS>
   Acknowledgement: https://example.com/hall-of-fame.html
   <CODE ENDS>

2.6.  Example

   <CODE BEGINS>
   # Our security address
   Contact: security@example.com

   # Our PGP key
   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt
   <CODE ENDS>

2.7.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via an IANA registry
   for headers fields as defined in Section 5.2.  Any fields registered
   via that process MUST be considered optional.  In order to encourage
   extensibility and interoperability, implementors MUST ignore any
   fields they do not explicitly support.

3.  File Format Description

   The expected file format of the security.txt file is plain text as
   defined in section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046] and encoded in UTF-8.

   The following is an ABNF definition of the security.txt format, using
   the conventions defined in [RFC5234].

   body = *line (contact-field eol) *line

   line = *1(field / comment) eol

   eol = *WSP [CR] LF

   field = contact-field / encryption-field / acknowledgement-field

   fs = ":"

   comment = "#" *(WSP / VCHAR / %xA0-E007F)

   contact-field = "Contact" fs SP (email / uri / phone)

   email = <Email address as per [RFC5322]>

   phone = "+" *1(DIGIT / "-" / "(" / ")" / SP)

   uri = <URI as per [RFC3986]>

   encryption-field = "Encryption" fs SP uri

   acknowledgement-field = "Acknowledgement" fs SP uri

4.  Security considerations

   Companies creating security.txt files will need to take several
   security-related issues into consideration.  These include exposure
   of sensitive information and attacks where limited access to a server
   could grant the ability to modify the contents of the security.txt
   file or affect how it is served.

   As stated in Section 2.4, keys specified using the "Encryption:"
   directive SHOULD be loaded over HTTPS.

5.  IANA Considerations

   example.com is used in this document following the uses indicated in
   [RFC2606].

5.1.  Well-Known URIs registry

   The "Well-Known URIs" registry should be updated with the following
   additional value (using the template from [RFC5785]):

   URI suffix: security.txt

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): this document

5.2.  Registry for security.txt Header Fields

   IANA is requested to create the "security.txt Header Fields" registry
   in accordance with [RFC8126].  This registry will contain header
   fields for use in security.txt files, defined by this specification.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Specification Required" guidelines as described in section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126].  Any new field thus registered is considered optional by
   this specification unless a new version of this specification is
   published.

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the field being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  The document in which the specification of the field is published

   5.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of: current: The field
       is in current use deprecated: The field is in current use but its
       use is discouraged historic: The field is no longer in current
       use

   An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating
   that a registered field is historic or deprecated if appropriate.

   The initial registry contains these values:
